      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
    <p>The main goal for this social media campaign is spreading awareness for our brand ANGEL. We want to achieve this by starting a movement online connected to the following hashtag: #Beanangeltoday. We used Instagram as our main platform and we used Tiktok for our #howtobeanangelchallenge. The campaign message we want learn our target audience is that even a small, simple act of kindness can have a huge impact on someone’s day and eventually their life.</p>
<p>  We choose Instagram as our main platform to promote our brand because of the visual features it offers. Instagram will be the place where all our shared content will come together. At the beginning we will start with posts about who ANGEL is and what we stand for, and later on we will promote our products. We will use the Instagram page to show the look and feel of ANGEL. </p>
<p>We choose TikTok as our second social media platform because this app gives the possibility to easily share and edit videos. Also TikTok is at this moment the fastest growing media platform in the Netherlands. It started out as a dancing app, but now the possibilities are endless.</p>
<div class="py-1"></div>
<div class="py-0">
    <p>Reach objective: By the end of this project on April 14th 2022, we want to have reached at least 100 followers on Instagram. - Before the 4th of April we want to reach a 500 views on one of our Tiktok videos from the #beanangeltodaychallenge. </p>
	<p>Affect objective: By the end of the project on April 14th 2022, we want the target audience to feel motivated by our content. </p>
	<p>Response objective: By the end of the project on April 14th 2022, we want to have at least 5 reposts on Instagram stories and 5 reactions on Instagram posts.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>During the length of this project our team learned a lot about the development of a brand. We started from scratch and built a full brand around it. We learned how to make a brand with a vision and values, how to think of and execute a social media campaign and how to build and launch a working website. There were certain things in our process that did not really work, for example that we wanted to post a Tiktok every day for two weeks. But there were things that did work such as the execution of the plan on Instagram. Even though the plan was to post every day in Tiktok, we did not expect to be able to do this. It takes up a lot of  time everyday but we did expect to be following up with the plan on Instagram and we did. Two weeks into the social media campaign we decided to add and remove some content from the content calendar, especially the TikTok content. The main reason for this change was that we discovered that the Tiktok challenge was unrealistic and not feasible. There was more time needed for the challenge than the time we calculated for it. We also posted a message with the value’s on the 25th of march, but were not satisfied with the result so we moved it to the archive and thought of something new, which took some time. Therefore the small gap in between the posts. Next time we would spend more time thinking about what is reachable for a team of three with so little time and make a better and more realistic plan. Also, at the start of the campaign we posted a lot of content with text. We noticed that we missed some color in the grid of Instagram, so we decided to go more visual and use more colorful pictures.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>We posted a total of five TikToks/Instagram Reels and 24 Instagram posts over the time span of four weeks. The following hashtags were often used: #beanangeltoday #beanangeltodaychallenge #movement #giveoneaway #kindness #smallgestures.</p>
<div class="py-0">
      <p>If we were to continue this campaign, we would continue with our #beanangeltoday challenge on TikTok and Instagram Reels by posting new ways to become an ANGEL every three days instead of aiming to post every day. We would do this because we learned during this project that posting every day is too much work when you are also busy with other work/ responsibilities and with a team of three students. New ways of becoming an ANGEL and thus, challenge days that we can post could be:</p>
<p>- Gift flowers to young strangers. This is an idea we wanted to conduct with our first campaign but we unfortunately did not get the chance.</p>
<p>- Do groceries with a young person who does not want to do this alone. This is an idea we wanted to conduct with our first campaign but we unfortunately did not get the chance.</p>
<p>- Bake a cake for a friend who feels lonely.</p>
<p>- Go on a walk with someone via the app ‘Amigos’. This could also become a partnership with this company.</p>
<p>- Send a friend an unexpected postcard.</p>
<p>- Paint some pebbles with the #beanangeltoday and the questions to send them/us a direct message and leave them for young people to find. This way we can have a chat with people who want to get in contact with new people. Maybe we can set up a community.</p>
 </div>
<p>We could also put some time in coming up with a new campaign to conduct on our social media channels to spread even more awareness about our brand.</p>
