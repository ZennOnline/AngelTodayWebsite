      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
    <p>The main goal for this social media campaign is spreading awareness for our brand ANGEL. We want to achieve this by starting a movement online connected to the following hashtag: #Beanangeltoday.</p>
<div class="py-2"></div>
<div class="py-0">
    <p>Reach objective: By the end of this project on April 14th 2022, we want to have reached at least 100 followers on Instagram. -&nbsp;Before the 4th of April we want to reach a 500 views on one of our Tiktok videos from the #beanangeltodaychallenge.</p>
	<p> Affect objective: By the end of the project on April 14th 2022, we want the target audience to feel motivated by our content.</p>
	<p>Response objective: By the end of the project on April 14th 2022, we want to have at least 5 reposts on Instagram stories and 5 reactions on Instagram posts.</p>
</div>
<div class="py-2"></div>
<div class="py-0">
	<p>We choose Instagram as our main platform to promote our brand because of the visual features it offers. Instagram will be the place where all our shared content will come together. At the beginning we will start with posts about who ANGEL is and what we stand for, and later on we will promote our products. We will use the Instagram page to show the look and feel of ANGEL.</p>
	<p>We choose TikTok as our second social media platform because this app gives the possibility to easily share and edit videos. Also TikTok is at this moment the fastest growing media platform in the Netherlands. It started out as a dancing app, but now the possibilities are endless.</p>
</div>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>During the length of this project our team learned a lot about the development of a brand. We started from scratch and built a full brand around it. We learned how to make a brand with a vision and values, how to think of and execute a social media campaign and how to build and launch a working website. There were certain things in our process that did not really work, for example that we wanted to post a TikTok every day for two weeks. But there were things that did work such as the execution of the plan on Instagram. Even though the plan was to post every day in TikTok, we did not expect to be able to do this. It takes up a lot of  time everyday but we did expect to be following up with the plan on Instagram and we did. Next time we would spend more time thinking about what is reachable for a team of three with so little time and make a better and more realistic plan.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>We posted a total of five TikToks/ Instagram Reels and 24 Instagram posts over the time span of four weeks. </p>
      <p>If we were to continue this campaign, we would continue with our #beanangeltoday challenge on TikTok and Instagram Reels by posting new ways to become an ANGEL every three days instead of aiming to post every day because we learned during this project that posting every day is too much work when you are also busy with other work/ responsibilities.</p>
